/* Directions:
 * 1. One or two days before we discuss a chapter in class, download this
 *    file (Intro.java), from I-Learn to your computer's hard drive.
 * 2. Answer all the questions in this file and save it.
 * 3. Rename the Java class and .java file to include your last name
 *    and first name.  For example, if my name were Rachelle Smith, I
 *    would rename the Java class below to SmithRachelleIntro
 *    and this file to SmithRachelleIntro.java
 * 4. Compile your renamed .java file and make sure it compiles without
 *    any errors.
 * 5. Submit your renamed .java file by copying it to your shared folder
 *    within your DropBox folder before class begins on the day we will
 *    discuss the corresponding chapter.
 * 6. At the beginning of class, the teacher will run a grading program
 *    which will e-mail you a score for each question.
 * 7. During class, we will discuss the material in the chapter, the
 *    teacher will present and demonstrate some concepts, and we will
 *    write example programs together.
 * 8. If you missed any of the questions, correct them and resubmit them
 *    before we study the next chapter.
 * 9. The teacher will run the grading program again and enter your score
 *    in the grade book.  Your score in the grade book will be your later
 *    score or double your first score, whichever is less.  In other
 *    words, in order to earn a score of 100% in the grade book for a set
 *    of chapter questions, you must get at least half the questions right
 *    on the first submission.
